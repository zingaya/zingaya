I'm a system administrator with +15 years of experience, focusing on infrastructure and monitoring.

I'm always learning and doing practical projects like setting up personal labs, trying out Proof-of-Concepts (POCs), and using tools such as Ansible, Bash, Github actions, and Zabbix for automation. You can find some of these in my repositories.
