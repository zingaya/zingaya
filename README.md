I have more than 10 years of experience as a system administrator, focusing on networking and monitoring. I have earned certifications as a Zabbix Specialist and Azure Administrator.

I'm always learning and doing practical projects like setting up personal labs, trying out Proof-of-Concepts (POCs), and using tools such as Ansible, Bash, Github actions, and Zabbix for automation. You can find some of these in my repositories.
