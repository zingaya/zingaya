I have more than 10 years of experience as a system administrator, focusing on networking and monitoring. I'm skilled at solving complex problems and have learned adaptable skills, especially in automating tasks, and incident foreseeing at long terms.
I've worked with small data centers and the Azure cloud platform, on production and critical environments, gaining diverse expertise in network administration, system security, and managing both Windows and Linux systems.

My primary focus is on mastering Zabbix for efficent and effective monitoring, integration and automation. I'm also dedicated to enhance my networking capabilities, currently skilled in protocols such as OSPF, IPsec VPN, VRRP, CEPh, VLAN configuration, and the management of both public and private DNS zones.

I'm always learning and doing practical projects like setting up personal labs, trying out Proof-of-Concepts (POCs), and using tools such as Ansible, Bash, Github actions, and Zabbix for automation.

I have earned certifications as a Zabbix Specialist and Azure Administrator, further validating my expertise in systems monitoring and Azure cloud management, respectively.

On my free time, I'm PC gamer where my preferences vary from FPS, open world, sandbox, to strategy games.
And as a second hobby, I'm cyclist where I mainly do route travels with my gravel bike. I don't hesitate to commute to the office in bike.
